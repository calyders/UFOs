# UFOs
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to add table filters to our UFO sightings webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis for users. This included city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
Utilizing the index.html file, I was able to go in and add further adjustments to the code in order to create more table filters. The specific code added is shown below.

The result of this added code is seen on the webpage as new filter search boxes for users to utilize.

## Summary
Using JavaScript, as well as the app.js and index.html files, I was able to create a webpage that showcases five different filter tables available for users to play with.

In the future, I think it would help make the page look more professional if city names and states were capitalized, as well as spelling out the full names of the states instead of just abbreviations.
